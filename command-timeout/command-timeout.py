"""
ðŸ“œ Prompt:
You're building a safe wrapper for running shell commands. Some commands might hang or take too long, so you want to enforce a timeout.

Write a function:


def run_with_timeout(cmd: str, timeout: int = 2) -> str:
    ...
ðŸ§ª Requirements:
Run the command using subprocess.

If it completes within timeout seconds, return its stdout as a string.

If it takes longer than timeout, terminate the command and return "Timed out".

ðŸ’¥ Bonus:
Return stderr output if the command fails.

Handle quoted strings and multi-word commands (e.g. echo "hello world")

    # early return for empty string or invalid timeout
    if not cmd or not (15 > timeout > 0):

    # we pass the command and timeout to the subprocess
